## GitHub Pages Deployment

This repository is structured to be deployed as a GitHub Pages site. The `index.html` file is the entry point, and all asset paths (CSS, JavaScript) are relative.

To publish this site on GitHub Pages:
1. Navigate to your repository's **Settings** tab on GitHub.
2. In the left sidebar, click on **Pages**.
3. Under "Build and deployment", for the **Source**, select **Deploy from a branch**.
4. Choose the branch you want to deploy (e.g., `main` or `master`) and the `/ (root)` folder.
5. Save the changes. GitHub will then build and deploy your site. You should see a URL where it's published.

The existing link [Playing around with HTML5 canvas and sorting algorithms](http://markberridge.github.io/sorted) suggests this might already be set up for the original repository. These instructions are for deploying your own fork or if the settings need to be reconfigured.
